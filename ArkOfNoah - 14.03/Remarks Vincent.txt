- It is better to create different files for every class
  - Your work can be more "readable" that way.
  - You do not have to "copy paste" that, you can do it in one shot.
    - Select it, right click on it, select "quick actions and refactorings", choose the good option

- Why you have problems with this exercise.
  - AllThePandas should not inherit from Panda
    - This is why it does not work
    - AllThePandas is not an "extension" of Panda
  - AllThePandas is not a special kind of Panda, it contains a list of Panda
  - Never use _ in variables that are public
    - The list should not be public, but private
    - It is a list of strings, it should be a list of Panda

  - You don't add the name of the panda, you add the panda itself to the list
