20230508 - VVDW (inside the previous remarks)

- I just looked at the class Person (I did not do the rest).
- There are hugh problems with it (because you don't do what is asked).

- Do you have 6 variables? (you have 1).
  - And the one you have is not asked
 LL - I thought properties were variables so I put the two togheter.
 
 VVDW - You are mixing again 2 things
      - Automatic properties does not use the variables you have created.
      - It can't be automatic properties here.

- Do you have 7 properties? (you have 8).

- You must correct this, really, because it makes your class unusable (because it is an agreement / a contract).
  - You have decided to make it differently.
 
  - What is the problem?
    - There is no method ShowInformation.
      - I'm the other programmer that expects a ShowInformation method
      LL - I get it. 
      VVDW - Why is the data type object? It is a string

    - There is a property AllInformation instead.
      - This property is useless, because it is the method ShowInformation
      
    - This is bad coding
      - Because AllInformation copies all the data for a second time in your class
      - 
      - The same thing can be said for _strAdress (typo in your name)
        - It copies all the information a second time in your class.
        - the variable should be in the getter scope, not in the class scope
        LL - ok

    - Having twice the same data in a class is always a bad idea.

  - Why has Adress a setter?
  - Why has AllInformation a setter?
  
Your other classes are correct programming (in the state person is)
- Typo in Compagny --> Company
LL - ok

The testprogram I have to test your code, fails.
- I have errors wherever I use "ShowInformation".

Do you understand what I'm trying to say here?

VVDW - Constructor person
     - only use _ for variables at the scope of the class.
     - remove the _ in the variable names here

VVDW - All the rest is pixel perfect.
     - Testprogram
     - Employee and student.
     - Great !!!
